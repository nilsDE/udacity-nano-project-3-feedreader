# Feedreader Project

For this project I have been given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! 
The missing test suites have been added by myself. 


## Test Suites

Test 1: Ensure all feeds in the allFeeds array have an URL and that the URL is not empty.
Test 2: Ensure all feeds in the allFeeds array have a name and that the name is not empty.
Test 3: Ensure the menu element is hidden by default.
Test 4: Ensure the menu element changes visibility when clicked (test with 2 clicks to test both states).
Test 5: Ensure the loadFeed function is called and that it completes its work and that there is at least one entry in the feed container.
Test 6: Ensure when a new feed is loaded that the content actually changes. 


## How to execute the tests
Download this repository: https://github.com/nilsDE/udacity-nano-project-3-feedreader
Open index.html in the browser. The tests execute automatically and the results will be diplayed at the bottom of the page.
